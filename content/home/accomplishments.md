  description = "Worked with common survey design structures, such as clustering and stratification, and learned how to visualize and analyze survey results. I modeled survey data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey using R's survey and tidyverse packages. Ultimately, I learned how to design and interpret surveys."

  description = "This course deepened my understanding of latent and manifest variables and ability to create measurement models, assess measurement model accuracy, and fix poor fitting models. During the course, I explored classic SEM datasets, such as the Holzinger and Swineford (1939) and Bollen (1989) datasets. I also worked through a multi-factor model case study using the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale."
