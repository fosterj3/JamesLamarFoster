Thank you for visiting my website. My name is James "Lamar"" Foster. You can just call me "Lamar." I'm a Ph.D. Candidate and GO-MAP Bank of America fellow at The University of Washington (UW). I use qualitative, quantitative, and mixed methods approaches to answer questions at the intersection of policy and practice. In particular, my research seeks to understand how local, state, and federal policies mediate the actions of school leaders seeking to make their schools more equitable when attending to the wellbeing of minoritized students.

Before pursuing my Ph.D., I taught and developed curriculum as an after-school program coordinator and mentor. While in this role I oversaw programming for over half a dozen schools. While teaching in these schools, I began to see the steep inequities between schools that predominately had students from low-income households and schools with a majority of students from affluent households. However, in one of the schools I worked in that predominately had students from low-income households, I noticed that the principal played an instrumental role in the school's climate and the students' overall wellbeing. Seeing how influential the principal of that school was spurred me to pursue my Ph.D. to research school leadership and student wellbeing.

I have presented my research at several prestigious conferences such as the American Educational Research Association (AERA), the University Council for Educational Administration (UCEA), and the Digital Media and Learning Conference. I currently serve as a graduate student council member for UCEA. I am also a research assistant for the Center for Evaluation and Research for STEM Equity (CERSE) at the University of Washington.

I enjoy reading, learning, and solving complex problems. I'm an avid R user ðŸ¤“ I mainly use R for data wrangling, statistics, and visualizations. As you peruse around my site, you will see examples of the ways I've used R to answer questions and illustrate new insights.
