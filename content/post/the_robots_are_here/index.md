The Robots are here! No, I’m not talking about Asimov’s conception of robots running the world or the Will Smith movie, I Robot, which is based on Asimov’s writing (for my millennial readers). When I say, “the robots are here,” I’m not referring to automation taking over everyday jobs causing massive unemployment and people having to learn new skills to keep up with the changing technology. When I say, “the robots are here,” I’m referring to the person you see every morning when you look in the mirror. Yes, that’s right, you and I are the robots!

When I think of robots, I think of emotionless and monotonous beings that struggle relating to one another, lacking in showing empathy, and spending the majority of their lifespan concerned about efficiency and productivity. Does this sound familiar? This phenomenon became clear to me when I began thinking deeply about the core of my dissertation work. My work centers on students’ well-being and how school leaders attend to Black and Brown students’ emotional needs. There has been an increase in public and private schools investing in curricula and initiatives that teach students how to name and regulate their emotions (which I find extremely important). You may have heard of some of the initiatives, such as student-centered approaches, Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports (PBIS), whole-child approaches, and/or social-emotional learning (SEL), to name a few. 

When I began reading more and talking to school leaders about some of these initiatives, particularly SEL, I kept asking myself, “what is the purpose of this and to what end?” As I read the literature and continued speaking to school leaders, the answer was troublesome. The purpose was to make happy, efficient, and productive robots. The goal wasn’t to ensure students were emotionally intelligent or for people to relate better with others, the goal was still efficiency and productivity. The goal is to make sure students will stay on task to get their classwork done, the goal was to make sure people could work with other people to finish an organization’s goals. Does this sound like a student-centered approach? This sounds more like a productivity-centered or authority-centered approach. 

Many of the school leaders I talked to use an SEL curriculum called RULER that is famous for its 4 color “Mood Meter.” Red means high energy – unpleasant, Blue is low energy – unpleasant, Green is low energy – pleasant, and Yellow is high energy – pleasant. But of course, all of these colors/emotions are on a spectrum. Some students may not be fully in the red or fully in the yellow, they may be somewhere in the middle. When I spoke to this particular school leader about their use of RULER, they told me that they see it as a helpful tool to identify how a student or teacher may be feeling so they can properly attend to their present needs (period).  

The school leader I spoke to acknowledged and understood that school is about kids, it’s not about grades, it’s not about being in the yellow quadrant, it’s not about following rules. As I sat back and thought about what I was learning from these school leaders, I got a glimpse of how the US’ capitalistic society has damned everything including our children’s education. As the US continues to innovate and produce new technologies to make our lives’ easier by asking Google or Alexa to turn on our lights or tell us a story, we devolved in our ability to talk to one another and show empathy because we’ve learned to do those things in the context of getting a task done. 

For us to thrive as a society - we can’t continue down the path of viewing emotional regulation as a means to an end - emotional regulation must be the end. Emotional intelligence must be the goal. Maybe it’s okay if you or your student is in the Red, maybe it’s okay if you’re in the Blue and feel like spending your day being comforted by your pets or speaking to your family. But, for it to be ok, we have to as a society realize that feeling is a what makes us human. Being human is a good thing. Let’s all try to be less like a robot and more like a human.
