These tumultuous times have given me a renewed interest in reading and listening to more Black scholars who have experienced and written about hardships in the United States. The author who I find myself coming back to each time I am trying to make sense of the world around me is James Baldwin. Baldwin quenches my thirst for needing to make sense of today's political and racial climate and my role as an educator. I turn to Baldwin because I know he will tell it to me straight, he won’t bite his tongue nor soften his tone in his writing. I know that each time I read Baldwin; he will give me the unfiltered truth without any equivocation. To help me make sense of my role as an educator in today's climate I went back and read his "A Talk to Teachers." 

For me, Baldwin's October 1963 speech entitled 'A Talk to Teachers' is one of those speeches where you can't help but nod your head in agreement after each point and ask yourself - 'what year was this written?' Despite being over 50 years old, educators have plenty to glean from the lessons Baldwin outlines in this speech. My goal with this essay is to contextualize the year 1963 and James Baldwin's speech, share some of Baldwin's lessons, and explain why they are relevant for educators in 2020 about to enter 2021.

1963 was a year of much uncertainty and unrest for many Americans, particularly African Americans. It started with George Wallace being elected governor of Alabama and giving an infamous speech in which he proclaimed, "segregation now, segregation tomorrow, and segregation forever!" Shortly thereafter in April, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Ralph Abernathy, Fred Shuttlesworth, and others were arrested in a Birmingham protest for "parading without a permit." This is also the same time MLK penned his now famously called "Birmingham Letters." In May, thousands of African Americans, many of them students, protested segregation in Birmingham. Public Safety Commissioner Eugene "Bull" Connor unleashed fire hoses and police dogs on protestors before arresting them. In June, Medgar Evers is assassinated in Jackson, Mississippi (his killer wasn't convicted until 1994). In August, MLK delivers his "I Have a Dream Speech" and in September The 16th Street Baptist Church bombing in Birmingham, Alabama kills four children and injures 22 others. 

As all this turmoil was occurring, students across the nation were getting up each day and going to school despite possibly listening on the radio and television to what was happening in Alabama and across the country. I would imagine you could feel the tension in each classroom. How should a teacher address their students given the political and racial climate? Can a teacher dismiss the politics for fear of being political and continue class as planned? Should teachers follow the advice my local school district gave its teachers and seek to be neutral? I imagine Baldwin would emphatically tell teachers not to give in to the lie. In such a time like this, there is no neutral space, neutrality is a myth hoped for by the pusillanimous.

As I carefully read through Baldwin's "A Talk to Teachers", I noticed three simple lessons he gave teachers: 1) speak the truth, 2) develop young people's critical consciousness, and 3) believe in the power within young people to change society. Without directly saying it, Baldwin gives these lessons with the understanding that in order for educators to enact these lessons, they must engage in critical self-reflection and do the work of uncovering the truth so they can then share it with their students.

Those residing in the United States are standing on stolen Indigenous land that was built by forcibly enslaved Africans for the benefit of White people. Any deviation from this harsh reality is simply untrue. However, similar to 1963, there is a fierce campaign for schools not to teach anything that may paint the United States in a negative light or as a villain, as evidenced by the federal government's 1776 commission and attacks against critical race theory. Educators must speak the truth about what this country has stood for and who it is designed to benefit. As Baldwin states, this country is not tormented externally, but internally. In his own words, he says "it is not really a “Negro revolution” that is upsetting the country. What is upsetting the country is a sense of its own identity." America is in a pivotal moment in that it has a decision to make on whether or not it wants to face its true identity and progress or continue promoting falsehoods and stall any potential growth.

The purpose of education, according to Baldwin, is to develop independent critical thinkers. Education is needed to help students look at the world and make their own decision by questioning society and the world so they can develop their identity. Baldwin warns teachers that this kind of person is not auspicious within this kind of society. US society simply wants a "citizenry which will obey the rules of society." Compliance has been a hallmark in many classrooms, even virtual ones. Compliance with rules that rob students of expressing how they feel and who they are voids compassion and understanding. Choosing to develop a person's critical consciousness rather than steering them to be more compliant can lead to young people to access the agency they have to create the change this society desperately needs. 

Baldwin says society's hope lies in the conviction and anger of young people. An anger that will lead to self-determination and collective action. The only way societies change is through people critically examining it and realizing its flaws and determining to change it. This is what true patriotism looks like. As Baldwin once said, "he critiques America because he loves America." If it was not for a person's commitment and love for their country, they would not develop such an emotion like anger when it does not live up to its potential. Educators have a unique role and opportunity to change the world by pouring into young people. However, in following Baldwin's charge, they must speak the truth, develop young people's critical consciousness, and believe that young people can change society for the better.

2020 is tough; there is no way around it. However, I believe teachers and educators across this nation need to heed the words of James Baldwin as teachers did in 1963. Baldwin's lessons are not just for the benefit of students of color, but for White students as well. As he says, "if one managed to change the curriculum in all the schools so that Negroes learned more about themselves and their real contributions to this culture, you would be liberating not only Negroes, you’d be liberating white people who know nothing about their own history." America can only be free when America speaks the truth.
