“What's the price for a black man life?
I check the toe tag, not one zero in sight
I turn the TV on, not one hero in sight”
-	J. Cole

On August 28, 1963, Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his renowned “I Have a Dream Speech.” In this speech, King expressed his aspirations for how the United States of America could one day look. An America where African descendants of slaves and European descendants of slave-owners could sit together as siblings and see each other as equals. An America where every person can sing the national anthem with a sense of pride and belief in the ideals expressed. An America where people are judge by their character and not by their skin color. This was King’s dream. A child today would most likely see’s King’s dream as something basic or mundane. As we know, it was nothing of the sort. I began to reflect on King’s dream these past two weeks when my dreams for the next couple of the years crashed into reality. 

Before the state issued stay-at-home orders to flatten the spread of coronavirus, I spent 2 hours of my day commuting to and from campus Monday through Friday. I used the ten extra hours I “gained” from not commuting to work on a few side projects and plan for life after graduation. I started building a website in preparation for when I get on the job market, my wife and I made a list of potential cities in which we wanted to live, I downloaded the Zillow app and began looking at the price of houses in the cities we listed. I started getting excited about the potential of moving and living somewhere that was more affordable and more racially diverse than Seattle. I got so enthralled with the possibility of moving to Minneapolis that I began dreaming about it. 

The possibility of moving to Minnesota seemed like the perfect plan. It was close to Canada, where my wife is from, a day’s drive from where my parents live in Tennessee, but more importantly, it’s racially diverse and affordable.  However, the dreams I was having about living in Minneapolis quickly turned into a nightmare. A nightmare that is the reality of many Black men living in America - the permanence of racism. 

The racially motivated murder of George Floyd by a police office is another example of how racism in this country continues to persist and manifest itself in different ways. Similar to King, I too have a dream. I dream to live in a society that values Black lives. A dream where de facto segregation is no more. King dreamed over 55 years ago, I dreamed a similar dream only a few weeks ago. However, both of our dreams seem out of reach. The evils of this country have brought me to tears, not just for George Floyd, but for Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, Tony McDade, and so many other unarmed people of color murdered because of their skin color. It begs me to ask what is the price of a Black life, when will Black people be able to dream without fear of racism? I don’t know the answer, but I once heard someone say – “teamwork makes the dreamwork.”

Racism was not created by Black people. On the contrary, it was created and reified by white people. Therefore, I’m convicted that it is not mine or any other Black person’s burden to eradicate racism, but rather the work of white people and those who benefit from racism. However, I can’t rest and dream easy until racism is a thing of the past. Therefore, Black, White, Indigenous, and Asian people need to work together so we can all rest and dream without fear.
