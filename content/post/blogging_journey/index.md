In my first year of graduate school, a professor told me that a Ph.D. is a writing degree more than anything else. He stated I will have to learn how to write for multiple audiences and receieve feedback from multiple people.That last part - getting feedback- made me self-conscious. I've never had an aversion to writing but ever since grade school, I've struggled with sharing my writing. My hesistance in sharing my writing is due to the possibility of being misunderstood and an insecurity in my ability to what I perceived to be on par with my peers.

As my third-year of graduate school and taking classes comes to an end, I realize that I've shared my writing with a countless number of professors, peers, and colleagues. As a result, I've seen an incredible amount of growth in my writing due to how often I've written academic papers and the feedback I've received. My perspective on sharing my writing has also changed. Rather than viewing it with fear and anxiety, I see it as a joy and opportunity to refine my writing. I hope to continue my writing growth by extending my writing audience. 

I hope to use this website as one mechanism to increase my writing audience so I can improve my writing. My desire with these posts are to share what I'm learning as a data analyst, researcher, academic, son, brother, and husband. I hope you all will join me on this journey by engaging with me via this website and [twitter](https://twitter.com/Jmar116). Let the journey begin!
