abstract: The accelerating pace of development of new information systems and related data management tools is one of the most dramatic features of organizational life in the early 21st century. However, focusing on the creation of new information technologies can easily lead policy makers, funders, and organizational leaders to overlook the challenges of implementing these technologies in the complex ecologies of institutional policy and practice. In this report, we summarize what we have learned from a review of 141 studies related to the implementation of new information technologies, focusing in particular on challenges accompanying the introduction and use of data dashboards in the fields of business, health sciences, and education. Our goal has been to draw on these research literatures to offer recommendations for academic leaders, technical assistance providers, and policy makers currently working to make data dashboards and related information technologies useful and used as tools for program improvement in teacher education.
