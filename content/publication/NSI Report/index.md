abstract: The University of Washington (UW) was commissioned by The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (The Gates Foundation) to describe the current state of the field of organizations’ readiness to develop and implement school improvement networks. To do so, we analyzed all of the applications The Gates Foundation received in response to a request for proposal (RFP), particularly regarding continuous improvement (CI), data use, and network support. We used a mixed-methods approach. First, we quantitatively analyzed 499 applications submitted to The Gates Foundation for the NSI grants (530 were submitted, but only 499 had text in WizeHive). Of these 499 applications, 118 applicants advanced beyond the initial application review stage. We then took a representative sample of the advanced applications (27) and conducted a qualitative analysis to identify trends focused on organizations’ capacity for CI, to use and collect data, and to support a network.
