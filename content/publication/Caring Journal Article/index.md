abstract: A growing number of schools are adopting social-emotional learning (SEL) programs to improve school climate and student’s academic achievement. The proliferation of school-based SEL programs has spurred more research on the ways in which SEL is implemented in schools, however, few studies have considered the role principals have in leading SEL initiatives. Abundant research has found principals play a critical role in determining how a school-based initiative is implemented. This qualitative single-case study uses the caring school leadership model to investigate a principal’s leadership actions when implementing an SEL initiative. The analysis elucidates how the principal focused their attention on the teacher’s social and emotional development as a way to ensure the students are developing socially and emotionally. This approach aligns with the caring leadership model in that the principal cultivated a community of caring in the school. Implications for research, policy, and practice are discussed.
