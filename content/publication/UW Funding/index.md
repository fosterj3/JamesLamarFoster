abstract: In an era where the necessity of a college degree has increased, yet the completion rate has decreased (Bound, Lovenheim, & Turner, 2010), universities are faced with the difficulty of ensuring college is affordable and students graduate on time. Attending a higher education institution has almost become as ubiquitous as attending high school (Fry, 2009). With this surge in applications and enrollment, higher education has become a large money-driven marketplace. This report takes a mixed-methods approach to identify and examine the issue of funding for students within the University of Washingtonâ€™s College of Education.
