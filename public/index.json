I use qualitative, quantitative, and mixed methods approaches to answer questions at the intersection of policy and practice. In particular, my research seeks to understand how local, state, and federal policies mediate the actions of school leaders seeking to make their schools more equitable when attending to the wellbeing of minoritized students.\nBefore pursuing my Ph.D., I taught and developed curriculum as an after-school program coordinator and mentor. While in this role I oversaw programming for over half a dozen schools. While teaching in these schools, I began to see the steep inequities between schools that predominately had students from low-income households and schools with a majority of students from affluent households. However, in one of the schools I worked in that predominately had students from low-income households, I noticed that the principal played an instrumental role in the school\u0026rsquo;s climate and the students\u0026rsquo; overall wellbeing. Seeing how influential the principal of that school was spurred me to pursue my Ph.D. to research school leadership and student wellbeing.\nI have presented my research at several prestigious conferences such as the American Educational Research Association (AERA), the University Council for Educational Administration (UCEA), and the Digital Media and Learning Conference. I currently serve as a graduate student council member for UCEA. I am also a research assistant for the Center for Evaluation and Research for STEM Equity (CERSE) at the University of Washington.\nI enjoy reading, learning, and solving complex problems.

My father served in the United States Army for 20 years, 11 months, and 4 days (he would mention this often when he first retired). My dad is what you would call ‚Äúa soldier‚Äôs soldier.‚Äù He was an Airborne Ranger who was also a marksman with air assault qualification. He was a drill sergeant and trained many other soldiers in combat warfare tactics. You would think with all these military accolades my dad was an avid gun user and had guns at home. On the contrary, my father never owned a gun outside of military use. In fact, I don‚Äôt ever remember a gun being brought in our house. Furthermore, my dad wouldn‚Äôt even allow me to have toy guns. Many of the kids I grew up around were also military brats (that‚Äôs what military kids referred to themselves as). Some of the kids I grew up around owned toy guns and would act like they were soldiers on the battlefield, shooting each other with dart guns. No matter how much I begged my dad to get me a toy gun, he refused.\nOne summer, when I was visiting my Aunt Vilma in Atlanta, she took me with her to run a few errands. I loved visiting Atlanta in the summer. My Aunt Vilma dedicated her life to be an elementary school teacher; she never had a significant other or kids. As a result, my sisters and I were the closest to being her children. While she and I were out, we stopped at the Dollar Store. As we perused the aisles to pick up a few essentials, I saw a green and yellow dart gun on the shelf. My eight-year-old self thought this was a perfect moment to finally get a toy gun. As my Aunt Vilma added things to the basket, I stealthily slipped in the dart gun. When the cashier started ringing up everything, my aunt looked at me and said, ‚Äúdid you put this in my basket?‚Äù (referring to the toy gun). I gave a big smile and pleaded, ‚Äúcan I please have it, Aunt Vilma?‚Äù She gave me a stoic look and allowed the cashier to ring it up. I was so elated. As soon as I got back to my aunt‚Äôs house, I loaded up the darts and started shooting at every glass surface in the house. My dad became aware of what I was doing and calmly asked to see the dart gun. I hesitantly gave it to him, knowing that he would not be happy. Once I handed it to him, he quickly broke it with his bare hands and threw it in the trash. I furiously ran to my mom and cried.\nMy mom and dad sat me down and told me that I couldn‚Äôt have a toy gun because people may perceive that I have a real gun and get me in trouble. I was so confused, ‚Äúmy other friends were allowed to have guns, why can‚Äôt I?‚Äù They said plainly, ‚Äúit‚Äôs because people perceive Black people differently than white people.‚Äù I exclaimed, ‚Äúthat\u0026rsquo;s not fair!‚Äù They agreed and said ‚Äúthat‚Äôs just the world we live in.‚Äù My dad had always been somewhat strict, I thought him not allowing me to have a toy gun was just another example of him being surly. At that moment, I didn‚Äôt believe what my parents were telling me. I saw my dad‚Äôs actions as just being mean and not wanting me to have any fun. I was a child; children play with toy guns. Why can‚Äôt I just be a child? I never owned a toy gun again.\nWhen my cousins and I would get together at my Aunt‚Äôs house, we would take our Aunt Vilma‚Äôs plastic decorative bananas and use them to play cops and robbers. It seemed so ridiculous, but it was our way of circumventing our parents‚Äô rule of not allowing us to have toy guns. As I got older, my desire to play cops and robbers began to subside. However, conversations on race and racism became more common. This was particularly true when I started dating and driving. My parents were wary of me dating anyone who was not a person of color because of the backlash that came with it. When I got my driver‚Äôs license, they instructed me on several occasions to not drive in certain neighborhoods and to watch my speed when I drove through different counties and cities, especially while driving in Tennessee where they ended up settling after my dad‚Äôs military career. When I went to college, I realized my upbringing was not that much different from other Black men.\nWhen I reflect on my upbringing, I realize how much racism controls/polices the way Black people interact in the world. I no longer resent my parents for not allowing me to own a toy gun. I realize they were merely trying to protect me. However, I can‚Äôt help but think about how racism has affected the way I move throughout the world, whether it‚Äôs something as simple as the toys I could play with as a child or the person I choose to love. However, despite the ostensible limitations racism has created for me and other Black people, we continue to beat the odds given to us. We continue to press forward and flourish. Despite the hardships, I wouldn‚Äôt want to be anything other than Black. Knowing that I come from a generation of people who have fought and died for liberation and equality gives me the strength to press on. My resilience comes from my faith and ancestors.\n","date":1591488000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1591595978,"objectID":"b11ab3c53f341c447fbec9dc6dfab4ea","permalink":"/post/cops-and-robbers/","publishdate":"2020-06-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/cops-and-robbers/","section":"post","summary":"Growing up Black","tags":["Race"],"title":"Cops and Robbers","type":"post"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"‚ÄúWhat\u0026rsquo;s the price for a black man life? I check the toe tag, not one zero in sight I turn the TV on, not one hero in sight‚Äù\n J. Cole  On August 28, 1963, Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his renowned ‚ÄúI Have a Dream Speech.‚Äù In this speech, King expressed his aspirations for how the United States of America could one day look. An America where African descendants of slaves and European descendants of slave-owners could sit together as siblings and see each other as equals. An America where every person can sing the national anthem with a sense of pride and belief in the ideals expressed. An America where people are judge by their character and not by their skin color. This was King‚Äôs dream. A child today would most likely see‚Äôs King‚Äôs dream as something basic or mundane. As we know, it was nothing of the sort. I began to reflect on King‚Äôs dream these past two weeks when my dreams for the next couple of the years crashed into reality.\nBefore the state issued stay-at-home orders to flatten the spread of coronavirus, I spent 2 hours of my day commuting to and from campus Monday through Friday. I used the ten extra hours I ‚Äúgained‚Äù from not commuting to work on a few side projects and plan for life after graduation. I started building a website in preparation for when I get on the job market, my wife and I made a list of potential cities in which we wanted to live, I downloaded the Zillow app and began looking at the price of houses in the cities we listed. I started getting excited about the potential of moving and living somewhere that was more affordable and more racially diverse than Seattle. I got so enthralled with the possibility of moving to Minneapolis that I began dreaming about it.\nThe possibility of moving to Minnesota seemed like the perfect plan. It was close to Canada, where my wife is from, a day‚Äôs drive from where my parents live in Tennessee, but more importantly, it‚Äôs racially diverse and affordable. However, the dreams I was having about living in Minneapolis quickly turned into a nightmare. A nightmare that is the reality of many Black men living in America - the permanence of racism.\nThe racially motivated murder of George Floyd by a police office is another example of how racism in this country continues to persist and manifest itself in different ways. Similar to King, I too have a dream. I dream to live in a society that values Black lives. A dream where de facto segregation is no more. King dreamed over 55 years ago, I dreamed a similar dream only a few weeks ago. However, both of our dreams seem out of reach. The evils of this country have brought me to tears, not just for George Floyd, but for Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, Tony McDade, and so many other unarmed people of color murdered because of their skin color. It begs me to ask what is the price of a Black life, when will Black people be able to dream without fear of racism? I don‚Äôt know the answer, but I once heard someone say ‚Äì ‚Äúteamwork makes the dreamwork.‚Äù\nRacism was not created by Black people. On the contrary, it was created and reified by white people. Therefore, I‚Äôm convicted that it is not mine or any other Black person‚Äôs burden to eradicate racism, but rather the work of white people and those who benefit from racism. However, I can‚Äôt rest and dream easy until racism is a thing of the past. Therefore, Black, White, Indigenous, and Asian people need to work together so we can all rest and dream without fear.\n","date":1591488000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1591579938,"objectID":"33243239806c1d4d494f2203928bd9f1","permalink":"/post/dream/","publishdate":"2020-06-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/dream/","section":"post","summary":"racism defering dreams","tags":[],"title":"I Have a Dream Too","type":"post"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Pursuing a Ph.D. can be an isolating process, especially for minoritized students. For me, I‚Äôve found that my family is incredibly proud of my scholastic pursuits and don‚Äôt miss an opportunity to express that to me. However, there is also the consistent and sometimes exasperating occurrence of having to explain the importance of milestones in this process, such as submitting comprehensive exams or getting a conference proposal accepted.\nPursuing a Ph.D. for minoritized students can result in situations of being one of the few people who look like you in your classes. In some cases, whenever issues of inequity come up, you are tacitly looked upon for commentary about the situation and an ambassador for your race, religion, and/or ethnicity. However, this isolation can also occur in an advisory group.\nAdvisory group, in case other institutions call it something else or don\u0026rsquo;t have it, is the time when a faculty member regularly brings all of their advisees together as a group for a check-in or some structured activity. For the most part, these spaces are curated by the faculty member because they are the ones who choose who they want to advise. I see the curation of an advisory group as an opportunity for faculty members to illustrate their commitment to equity. A faculty member\u0026rsquo;s advisory group, to some extent, is a reflection of them.\nIf you‚Äôre a faculty member committed to equity, anti-racism, critical consciousness, then you have to ask yourself ‚Äì what is the extent of my commitment to these ideals? Is equity something I just write about or is it something that influences my daily decisions as I interact within the different communities I am in. Is your advisory group pretty much homogenous in terms of race, language, religion, status, gender, and lived experience? If so, what does that say about your commitment to equity? Is equity something you merely write about or does it go deeper than that?\nThe way you interact with your academic community (conferences, journal reviews, scholarship, etc.), university community (faculty members, staff, grad students, etc.), and local community (neighbors, local nonprofits, community centers, etc.) should be a reflection of that commitment.

He stated I will have to learn how to write for multiple audiences and receieve feedback from multiple people.That last part - getting feedback- made me self-conscious. I\u0026rsquo;ve never had an aversion to writing but ever since grade school, I\u0026rsquo;ve struggled with sharing my writing. My hesistance in sharing my writing is due to the possibility of being misunderstood and an insecurity in my ability to what I perceived to be on par with my peers.\nAs my third-year of graduate school and taking classes comes to an end, I realize that I\u0026rsquo;ve shared my writing with a countless number of professors, peers, and colleagues. As a result, I\u0026rsquo;ve seen an incredible amount of growth in my writing due to how often I\u0026rsquo;ve written academic papers and the feedback I\u0026rsquo;ve received. My perspective on sharing my writing has also changed. Rather than viewing it with fear and anxiety, I see it as a joy and opportunity to refin my writing. I hope to continue my writing growth by extending my writing audience.\nI hope to use this website as one mechanism to increase my writing audience so I can improve my writing.

Simultaneously YPAR works to create more socially just schools where youth are encouraged to take a lead in questioning policies and educational practices, including unequal power relations in our schools and society (Cammarota \u0026amp; Fine, 2008; Duncan Andrade \u0026amp; Morrell, 2008; Ginwright, Noguera, \u0026amp; Cammarota, 2006).\nYouth Films Collaborative (YFC) is a digital media initiative between Obama Academy (Pittsburgh Public Schools) and the Canevin Center for Educational Transformation and Social Justice at Duquesne University, in consultation with a faculty member from Nazareth College in Rochester, NY.\nBy providing a collaborative, experimental, mentored space in schools for 11th grade students, this project aims to sharpen participants‚Äô digital video production skills and give them new ways of engaging with a range of important critical multimodal literacy practices. More specifically, the YFC engages youth in the development of mini-documentary films on equity and social justice issues that are timely and relevant for youth-schools-communities using their ‚Äúvoice‚Äù. The concept of voice is used to show how people resist oppression, as seen in many feminist and post-feminist theories (Belenky, Clinchy, Goldberger, \u0026amp; Tarule, 1986; hooks, 2000). Voice also refers to instances where youth attempt to overcome and resist the ways in which schools and communities work to silence (Fine, 2003) and marginalize students by reproducing inequalities on account of race, class, gender, disability, and sexuality (Bowles \u0026amp; Gintis, 1976; Oakes, 1985). Voice is used in this presentation to question who gets to speak and who gets to make decisions with regard to school and community issues that directly impact youth. As such, the YFC seeks to cultivate reflective and change-centered processes (including the development of youth‚Äôs critical thinking and research skills), as well as practices which promote relationship building and inter-cultural dialogue with peers and adults in and outside of school.\nOver the course of the 2104-2015, we are in the process of: ‚Ä¢\tIdentifying community issues that are important to youth ‚Ä¢\tAsking essential research questions about the community issues ‚Ä¢\tCollecting data and reading literature on the issue ‚Ä¢\tCreating a mini-documentary on a social issue ‚Ä¢\tDistributing the video online, through social media, and film festivals and in public screenings ‚Ä¢\tOrganizing ‚Äúaction events‚Äù around their video with the following questions - What is the change that you would like to see with regard to the community issue? How do we create action around the message in the mini-documentary film?\n","date":1430611200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1430611200,"objectID":"3ed17cb02c96c07b4937887166efd23d","permalink":"/project/youth-films-collaborative/","publishdate":"2015-05-03T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/youth-films-collaborative/","section":"project","summary":"Youth Participatory Action Research to spur collective action","tags":["Equity","Qualitative Methods"],"title":"Youth Film Collaborative- Using Youth Participatory Action Research, Art and Collective Action to Address Community Issues","type":"project"}]
