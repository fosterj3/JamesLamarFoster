[{"authors":"admin","categories":null,"content":"Thank you for visiting my website. My name is James \u0026ldquo;Lamar\u0026rdquo; Foster. You can just call me \u0026ldquo;Lamar.\u0026rdquo; I\u0026rsquo;m a Ph.D. Candidate and GO-MAP Bank of America fellow at The University of Washington (UW). I use qualitative, quantitative, and mixed methods approaches to answer questions at the intersection of policy and practice. In particular, my research seeks to understand how local, state, and federal policies mediate the actions of school leaders seeking to make their schools more equitable when attending to the wellbeing of minoritized students.\nBefore pursuing my Ph.D., I taught and developed curriculum as an after-school program coordinator and mentor. While in this role I oversaw programming for over half a dozen schools. While teaching in these schools, I began to see the steep inequities between schools that had predominately low-income students and schools with affluent students. However, in one of the schools I worked in that predominately had students from low-income households, I noticed that the principal played an instrumental role in the school\u0026rsquo;s climate and the students\u0026rsquo; overall wellbeing. Seeing how influential the principal of that school was spurred me to pursue my Ph.D. to research school leadership and student wellbeing.\nI have presented my research at several prestigious conferences such as the American Educational Research Association (AERA), the University Council for Educational Administration (UCEA), and the Digital Media and Learning Conference. I currently serve as a graduate student council member for UCEA and a graduate student assistant for the UW\u0026rsquo;s Office of Student Diversity and Inclusion.\nI enjoy reading, learning, and solving complex problems. I\u0026rsquo;m an avid R user 🤓 I mainly use R for statistics, data analysis, and visualizations. As you peruse around my site, you will see examples of the ways I\u0026rsquo;ve used R to answer questions and illustrate new insights. Feel free to hit the contact button or follow me on twitter to reach out to me. I look forward to connecting with you 😊\nTweets by Jmar116  ","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"taxonomy","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"/author/james-lamar-foster/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/author/james-lamar-foster/","section":"authors","summary":"Thank you for visiting my website.

For me, I’ve found that my family is incredibly proud of my scholastic pursuits and don’t miss an opportunity to express that to me. However, there is also the consistent and sometimes exasperating occurrence of having to explain the importance of milestones in this process, such as submitting comprehensive exams or getting a conference proposal accepted.\nPursuing a Ph.D. for minoritized students can result in situations of being one of the few people who look like you in your classes. In some cases, whenever issues of inequity come up, you are tacitly looked upon for commentary about the situation and an ambassador for your race, religion, and/or ethnicity. However, this isolation can also occur in an advisory group.\nAdvisory group, in case other institutions call it something else or don\u0026rsquo;t have it, is the time when a faculty member regularly brings all of their advisees together as a group for a check-in or some structured activity. For the most part, these spaces are curated by the faculty member because they are the ones who choose who they want to advise. I see the curation of an advisory group as an opportunity for faculty members to illustrate their commitment to equity. A faculty member\u0026rsquo;s advisory group, to some extent, is a reflection of them.\nIf you’re a faculty member committed to equity, anti-racism, critical consciousness, then you have to ask yourself – what is the extent of my commitment to these ideals? Is equity something I just write about or is it something that influences my daily decisions as I interact within the different communities I am in. Is your advisory group pretty much homogenous in terms of race, language, religion, status, gender, and lived experience? If so, what does that say about your commitment to equity? Is equity something you merely write about or does it go deeper than that?\nThe way you interact with your academic community (conferences, journal reviews, scholarship, etc.), university community (faculty members, staff, grad students, etc.), and local community (neighbors, local nonprofits, community centers, etc.) should be a reflection of that commitment. What are you reflecting?\n","date":1587513600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1587617596,"objectID":"e5c243f08e0292d2194415c72aff378b","permalink":"/post/reflecting/","publishdate":"2020-04-22T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/reflecting/","section":"post","summary":"How does equity show up in your daily activities?","tags":["Equity","Graduate School"],"title":"What are You Reflecting?","type":"post"},{"authors":["Foster, J.L."],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1585699200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1585699200,"objectID":"7ca8607c31c18d1cb52701a178ba5c44","permalink":"/publication/caring-journal-article/","publishdate":"2020-04-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/caring-journal-article/","section":"publication","summary":"This qualitative single case-study examines how a principal uses an ethic of care to lead a social-emotional learning initiative","tags":["School Leadership","Caring Leadership","Social-emotional learning","Qualitative Methods","Equity","Policy"],"title":"A Caring Approach to Leading a Social-Emotional Learning Initiative (Under Review)","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"In my first year of graduate school, a professor told me that a Ph.D. is a writing degree more than anything else. He stated I will have to learn how to write for multiple audiences and receieve feedback from multiple people.That last part - getting feedback- made me self-conscious. I\u0026rsquo;ve never had an aversion to writing but ever since grade school, I\u0026rsquo;ve struggled with sharing my writing. My hesistance in sharing my writing is due to the possibility of being misunderstood and an insecurity in my ability to what I perceived to be on par with my peers.\nAs my third-year of graduate school and taking classes comes to an end, I realize that I\u0026rsquo;ve shared my writing with a countless number of professors, peers, and colleagues. As a result, I\u0026rsquo;ve seen an incredible amount of growth in my writing due to how often I\u0026rsquo;ve written academic papers and the feedback I\u0026rsquo;ve received. My perspective on sharing my writing has also changed. Rather than viewing it with fear and anxiety, I see it as a joy and opportunity to refin my writing. I hope to continue my writing growth by extending my writing audience.\nI hope to use this website as one mechanism to increase my writing audience so I can improve my writing. My desire with these posts are to share what I\u0026rsquo;m learning as a data analyst, researcher, academic, son, brother, and husband. I hope you all will join me on this journey by engaging with me via this website and twitter.

Before creating these plots I combined five different data frames (years 2015-2019) of high school graduation in the entire state of Washington. After combining the data frames, I wrangled the data using dplyr from the tidyverse package in R. After filtering the dataframe to only capture my desired observations, I then used ggplot2 to create the graph, gganimate to animate the plots, and cowplot to make a multipanel plot of the two plots

Simultaneously YPAR works to create more socially just schools where youth are encouraged to take a lead in questioning policies and educational practices, including unequal power relations in our schools and society (Cammarota \u0026amp; Fine, 2008; Duncan Andrade \u0026amp; Morrell, 2008; Ginwright, Noguera, \u0026amp; Cammarota, 2006).\nYouth Films Collaborative (YFC) is a digital media initiative between Obama Academy (Pittsburgh Public Schools) and the Canevin Center for Educational Transformation and Social Justice at Duquesne University, in consultation with a faculty member from Nazareth College in Rochester, NY.\nBy providing a collaborative, experimental, mentored space in schools for 11th grade students, this project aims to sharpen participants’ digital video production skills and give them new ways of engaging with a range of important critical multimodal literacy practices. More specifically, the YFC engages youth in the development of mini-documentary films on equity and social justice issues that are timely and relevant for youth-schools-communities using their “voice”. The concept of voice is used to show how people resist oppression, as seen in many feminist and post-feminist theories (Belenky, Clinchy, Goldberger, \u0026amp; Tarule, 1986; hooks, 2000). Voice also refers to instances where youth attempt to overcome and resist the ways in which schools and communities work to silence (Fine, 2003) and marginalize students by reproducing inequalities on account of race, class, gender, disability, and sexuality (Bowles \u0026amp; Gintis, 1976; Oakes, 1985). Voice is used in this presentation to question who gets to speak and who gets to make decisions with regard to school and community issues that directly impact youth. As such, the YFC seeks to cultivate reflective and change-centered processes (including the development of youth’s critical thinking and research skills), as well as practices which promote relationship building and inter-cultural dialogue with peers and adults in and outside of school.\nOver the course of the 2104-2015, we are in the process of: •\tIdentifying community issues that are important to youth •\tAsking essential research questions about the community issues •\tCollecting data and reading literature on the issue •\tCreating a mini-documentary on a social issue •\tDistributing the video online, through social media, and film festivals and in public screenings •\tOrganizing “action events” around their video with the following questions - What is the change that you would like to see with regard to the community issue? How do we create action around the message in the mini-documentary film?\n","date":1430611200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1430611200,"objectID":"3ed17cb02c96c07b4937887166efd23d","permalink":"/project/youth-films-collaborative/","publishdate":"2015-05-03T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/youth-films-collaborative/","section":"project","summary":"Youth Participatory Action Research to spur collective action","tags":["Equity","Qualitative Methods","School Improvement"],"title":"Youth Film Collaborative- Using Youth Participatory Action Research, Art and Collective Action to Address Community Issues","type":"project"}]
