I use qualitative, quantitative, and mixed methods approaches to answer questions at the intersection of policy and practice. In particular, my research seeks to understand how local, state, and federal policies mediate the actions of school leaders seeking to make their schools more equitable when attending to the wellbeing of minoritized students.\nBefore pursuing my Ph.D., I taught and developed curriculum as an after-school program coordinator and mentor. While in this role I oversaw programming for over half a dozen schools. While teaching in these schools, I began to see the steep inequities between schools that predominately had students from low-income households and schools with a majority of students from affluent households. However, in one of the schools I worked in that predominately had students from low-income households, I noticed that the principal played an instrumental role in the school\u0026rsquo;s climate and the students\u0026rsquo; overall wellbeing. Seeing how influential the principal of that school was spurred me to pursue my Ph.D. to research school leadership and student wellbeing.\nI have presented my research at several prestigious conferences such as the American Educational Research Association (AERA), the University Council for Educational Administration (UCEA), and the Digital Media and Learning Conference. I currently serve as a graduate student council member for UCEA. I am also a research assistant for the Center for Evaluation and Research for STEM Equity (CERSE) at the University of Washington.\nI enjoy reading, learning, and solving complex problems.

No, I‚Äôm not talking about Asimov‚Äôs conception of robots running the world or the Will Smith movie, I Robot, which is based on Asimov‚Äôs writing (for my millennial readers). When I say, ‚Äúthe robots are here,‚Äù I‚Äôm not referring to automation taking over everyday jobs causing massive unemployment and people having to learn new skills to keep up with the changing technology. When I say, ‚Äúthe robots are here,‚Äù I‚Äôm referring to the person you see every morning when you look in the mirror. Yes, that‚Äôs right, you and I are the robots!\nWhen I think of robots, I think of emotionless and monotonous beings that struggle relating to one another, lacking in showing empathy, and spending the majority of their lifespan concerned about efficiency and productivity. Does this sound familiar? This phenomenon became clear to me when I began thinking deeply about the core of my dissertation work. My work centers on students‚Äô well-being and how school leaders attend to Black and Brown students‚Äô emotional needs. There has been an increase in public and private schools investing in curricula and initiatives that teach students how to name and regulate their emotions (which I find extremely important). You may have heard of some of the initiatives, such as student-centered approaches, Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports (PBIS), whole-child approaches, and/or social-emotional learning (SEL), to name a few.\nWhen I began reading more and talking to school leaders about some of these initiatives, particularly SEL, I kept asking myself, ‚Äúwhat is the purpose of this and to what end?‚Äù As I read the literature and continued speaking to school leaders, the answer was troublesome. The purpose was to make happy, efficient, and productive robots. The goal wasn‚Äôt to ensure students were emotionally intelligent or for people to relate better with others, the goal was still efficiency and productivity. The goal is to make sure students will stay on task to get their classwork done, the goal was to make sure people could work with other people to finish an organization‚Äôs goals. Does this sound like a student-centered approach? This sounds more like a productivity-centered or authority-centered approach.\nMany of the school leaders I talked to use an SEL curriculum called RULER that is famous for its 4-color ‚ÄúMood Meter.‚Äù Red means high energy ‚Äì unpleasant, Blue is low energy ‚Äì unpleasant, Green is low energy ‚Äì pleasant, and Yellow is high energy ‚Äì pleasant. But of course, all of these colors/emotions are on a spectrum. Some students may not be fully in the red or fully in the yellow, they may be somewhere in the middle. I spoke to a particular school leader about their use of RULER; they told me that they see it as a helpful tool to identify how a student or teacher may be feeling so they can properly attend to students\u0026rsquo; or teachers\u0026rsquo; present needs (period).\nThe school leader I spoke to acknowledged and understood that school is about kids, it‚Äôs not about grades, it‚Äôs not about being in the yellow quadrant, it‚Äôs not about following rules. As I sat back and thought about what I was learning from this particular school leader, I thought about how the US‚Äô capitalistic society has damned everything including our children‚Äôs emotions and the ways in which we relate to one another. As the US continues to innovate and produce new technologies to make our lives‚Äô easier by asking Google or Alexa to turn on our lights or tell us a story, we devolved in our ability to talk to one another and show empathy because we‚Äôve learned to do those things in the context of getting a task done.\nFor us to thrive as a society - we can‚Äôt continue down the path of viewing emotional regulation as a means to an end - emotional regulation must be the end. Emotional intelligence must be the goal. Maybe it‚Äôs okay if you or your student is in the Red, maybe it‚Äôs okay if you‚Äôre in the Blue and feel like spending your day being comforted by your pets or speaking to your family. But, for it to be ok, we have to as a society realize that feeling is a what makes us human. Being human is a good thing. Let‚Äôs all try to be less like a robot and more like a human.\n","date":1606608000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1606704674,"objectID":"ac59b1ad100e7011c6ae7b5afff5dd41","permalink":"/post/the_robots_are_here/","publishdate":"2020-11-29T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/the_robots_are_here/","section":"post","summary":"Let's be humans instead of robots","tags":["Emotions","Education","SEL"],"title":"The Robots Are Here!","type":"post"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"These tumultuous times have renewed my interest in reading and listening to more Black scholars who have experienced and written about hardships in the United States. I find myself going back to the writings of James Baldwin for clarity and understanding. Baldwin quenches my thirst for needing to make sense of today\u0026rsquo;s political and racial climate and my role as an educator. I turn to Baldwin because I know he will tell it to me straight, he won‚Äôt bite his tongue nor soften his tone in his writing. I know that each time I read Baldwin; he will give me the unfiltered truth without any equivocation. To help me make sense of my role in education in today\u0026rsquo;s climate, I turned to Baldwin‚Äôs \u0026ldquo;A Talk to Teachers.\u0026rdquo; Despite this talk being over 50 years old, first given in 1963, educators have plenty to glean from this talk.\nThe year 1963 had much uncertainty and unrest for many Americans, particularly African Americans. It started with George Wallace being elected governor of Alabama and giving an infamous speech in which he proclaimed, \u0026ldquo;segregation now, segregation tomorrow, and segregation forever!\u0026rdquo; Shortly thereafter in April, Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Rev. Ralph Abernathy, Rev. Fred Shuttlesworth, and others were arrested in a Birmingham protest for \u0026ldquo;parading without a permit.\u0026rdquo; This is also the same time MLK penned his now famously called \u0026ldquo;Letter from Birmingham Jail.\u0026rdquo; In May, thousands of African Americans, many of them students, protested segregation in Birmingham. Public Safety Commissioner Eugene \u0026ldquo;Bull\u0026rdquo; Connor unleashed fire hoses and police dogs on protestors before arresting them. In June, Medgar Evers is assassinated in Jackson, Mississippi (his killer wasn\u0026rsquo;t convicted until 1994). In September, The 16th Street Baptist Church bombing in Birmingham, Alabama killed four children and injures 22 others. The following month in October, is when Baldwin gave his talk to teachers.\nAs all this turmoil was occurring, students across the nation were getting up each day and going to school knowing what was happening in Alabama and across the country. How should a teacher address their students given the political and racial climate? Can a teacher dismiss the politics for fear of being political and continue class as planned? Should teachers seek to be neutral? I imagine Baldwin would emphatically tell teachers not to give in to the lie. In such a time like this, there is no neutral space, neutrality is a myth hoped for by the faint-hearted. As I read Baldwin\u0026rsquo;s talk, I noticed three simple lessons he gave teachers: 1) speak the truth, 2) develop young people\u0026rsquo;s critical consciousness, and 3) believe in the power within young people to change society. Baldwin gives these lessons with the understanding that in order for educators to enact these lessons, they must engage in their own critical self-reflection and questioning of society.\nUnited States residents are standing on stolen Indigenous land that was built by forcibly enslaved Africans for the benefit of White people. Any deviation from this harsh reality is simply untrue. However, similar to 1963, there is a fierce campaign for schools not to teach anything that may paint the United States in a negative light, as evidenced by the federal government\u0026rsquo;s 1776 commission and attacks against critical race theory. Educators must speak the truth about what this country has stood for and who it is designed to benefit. As Baldwin states, this country is not tormented externally, but internally. In his own words, he says \u0026ldquo;it is not really a ‚ÄúNegro revolution‚Äù that is upsetting the country. What is upsetting the country is a sense of its own identity.\u0026rdquo; America is in a pivotal moment in that it has a decision to make on whether or not it wants to face its true identity and progress or continue promoting falsehoods and stall any potential growth.\nAccording to Baldwin, the purpose of education is to develop independent critical thinkers. Education is needed to help students look at the world and make their own decision by questioning society and the world so they can develop their identity. Baldwin warns teachers that this kind of person is not auspicious within US society. He says the US simply wants a \u0026ldquo;citizenry which will obey the rules of society.\u0026rdquo; Compliance has been a hallmark in many classrooms, even virtual ones. Such compliance can rob students of expressing how they feel and who they are. Choosing to develop a person\u0026rsquo;s critical consciousness rather than steering them to be more compliant can lead to young people to access the agency they have to create the change this society desperately needs.\nBaldwin says society\u0026rsquo;s hope lies in the convictions of young people, convictions that will lead to self-determination and collective action. Societies change when people critically examine them and take action to change them. Baldwin once said, he criticizes America because he loves America. If it was not for a person\u0026rsquo;s commitment and love for their country, they would not develop such convictions and critique it when it does not live up to its potential. Educators have a unique role and opportunity to change the world by pouring into young people. In his talk with Nikki Giovanni, Baldwin called teaching a ‚Äúrevolutionary act.‚Äù The revolution begins by teachers speaking the truth, developing young people\u0026rsquo;s critical consciousness, and believing that young people can change society for the better.\nThe year 2020 has been tough for everyone. I believe teachers and educators across this nation need to heed the words of James Baldwin as they did in 1963. Baldwin\u0026rsquo;s lessons are not just for the benefit of students of color, but for White students as well. As he says, \u0026ldquo;if one managed to change the curriculum in all the schools so that Negroes learned more about themselves and their real contributions to this culture, you would be liberating not only to Negroes, you‚Äôd be liberating white people who know nothing about their own history.\u0026rdquo; America can only be free when America teaches the truth.\n","date":1601942400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1602039074,"objectID":"bb6d68c17c343025dbcd71f68d6fa1c7","permalink":"/post/a_talk_to_teachers/","publishdate":"2020-10-06T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/a_talk_to_teachers/","section":"post","summary":"A lesson for today from Baldwin","tags":["Teaching","Criticality","Education"],"title":"A Talk to Teachers","type":"post"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"I grew up in a military household. My father served in the United States Army for 20 years, 11 months, and 4 days (he would mention this often when he first retired). My dad is what you would call ‚Äúa soldier‚Äôs soldier.‚Äù He was an Airborne Ranger who was also a marksman with air assault qualification. He was a drill sergeant and trained many other soldiers in combat warfare tactics. You would think with all these military accolades my dad was an avid gun user and had guns at home. On the contrary, my father never owned a gun outside of military use. In fact, I don‚Äôt ever remember a gun being brought in our house. Furthermore, my dad wouldn‚Äôt even allow me to have toy guns. Many of the kids I grew up around were also military brats (that‚Äôs what military kids referred to themselves as). Some of the kids I grew up around owned toy guns and would act like they were soldiers on the battlefield, shooting each other with dart guns. No matter how much I begged my dad to get me a toy gun, he refused.\nOne summer, when I was visiting my Aunt Vilma in Atlanta, she took me with her to run a few errands. I loved visiting Atlanta in the summer. My Aunt Vilma dedicated her life to be an elementary school teacher; she never had a significant other or kids. As a result, my sisters and I were the closest to being her children. While she and I were out, we stopped at the Dollar Store. As we perused the aisles to pick up a few essentials, I saw a green and yellow dart gun on the shelf. My eight-year-old self thought this was a perfect moment to finally get a toy gun. As my Aunt Vilma added things to the basket, I stealthily slipped in the dart gun. When the cashier started ringing up everything, my aunt looked at me and said, ‚Äúdid you put this in my basket?‚Äù (referring to the toy gun). I gave a big smile and pleaded, ‚Äúcan I please have it, Aunt Vilma?‚Äù She gave me a stoic look and allowed the cashier to ring it up. I was so elated. As soon as I got back to my aunt‚Äôs house, I loaded up the darts and started shooting at every glass surface in the house. My dad became aware of what I was doing and calmly asked to see the dart gun. I hesitantly gave it to him, knowing that he would not be happy. Once I handed it to him, he quickly broke it with his bare hands and threw it in the trash. I furiously ran to my mom and cried.\nMy mom and dad sat me down and told me that I couldn‚Äôt have a toy gun because people may perceive that I have a real gun and get me in trouble. I was so confused, ‚Äúmy other friends were allowed to have guns, why can‚Äôt I?‚Äù They said plainly, ‚Äúit‚Äôs because people perceive Black people differently than white people.‚Äù I exclaimed, ‚Äúthat\u0026rsquo;s not fair!‚Äù They agreed and said ‚Äúthat‚Äôs just the world we live in.‚Äù My dad had always been somewhat strict, I thought him not allowing me to have a toy gun was just another example of him being surly. At that moment, I didn‚Äôt believe what my parents were telling me. I saw my dad‚Äôs actions as just being mean and not wanting me to have any fun. I was a child; children play with toy guns. Why can‚Äôt I just be a child? I never owned a toy gun again.\nWhen my cousins and I would get together at my Aunt‚Äôs house, we would take our Aunt Vilma‚Äôs plastic decorative bananas and use them to play cops and robbers. It seemed so ridiculous, but it was our way of circumventing our parents‚Äô rule of not allowing us to have toy guns. As I got older, my desire to play cops and robbers began to subside. However, conversations on race and racism became more common. This was particularly true when I started dating and driving. My parents were wary of me dating anyone who was not a person of color because of the backlash that came with it. When I got my driver‚Äôs license, they instructed me on several occasions to not drive in certain neighborhoods and to watch my speed when I drove through different counties and cities, especially while driving in Tennessee where they ended up settling after my dad‚Äôs military career. When I went to college, I realized my upbringing was not that much different from other Black men.\nWhen I reflect on my upbringing, I realize how much racism controls/polices the way Black people interact in the world. I no longer resent my parents for not allowing me to own a toy gun. I realize they were merely trying to protect me. However, I can‚Äôt help but think about how racism has affected the way I move throughout the world, whether it‚Äôs something as simple as the toys I could play with as a child or the person I choose to love. However, despite the ostensible limitations racism has created for me and other Black people, we continue to beat the odds given to us. We continue to press forward and flourish. Despite the hardships, I wouldn‚Äôt want to be anything other than Black. Knowing that I come from a generation of people who have fought and died for liberation and equality gives me the strength to press on. My resilience comes from my faith and ancestors.\n","date":1591488000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1591595978,"objectID":"4a09e77093b5dd22a8bc7f2040a9940a","permalink":"/post/cops-and-robbers/","publishdate":"2020-06-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/cops-and-robbers/","section":"post","summary":"Growing up Black","tags":["Race","Education"],"title":"Cops and Robbers","type":"post"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"‚ÄúWhat\u0026rsquo;s the price for a black man life? I check the toe tag, not one zero in sight I turn the TV on, not one hero in sight‚Äù\n J. Cole  On August 28, 1963, Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his renowned ‚ÄúI Have a Dream Speech.‚Äù In this speech, King expressed his aspirations for how the United States of America could one day look. An America where African descendants of slaves and European descendants of slave-owners could sit together as siblings and see each other as equals. An America where every person can sing the national anthem with a sense of pride and belief in the ideals expressed. An America where people are judge by their character and not by their skin color. This was King‚Äôs dream. A child today would most likely see‚Äôs King‚Äôs dream as something basic or mundane. As we know, it was nothing of the sort. I began to reflect on King‚Äôs dream these past two weeks when my dreams for the next couple of the years crashed into reality.\nBefore the state issued stay-at-home orders to flatten the spread of coronavirus, I spent 2 hours of my day commuting to and from campus Monday through Friday. I used the ten extra hours I ‚Äúgained‚Äù from not commuting to work on a few side projects and plan for life after graduation. I started building a website in preparation for when I get on the job market, my wife and I made a list of potential cities in which we wanted to live, I downloaded the Zillow app and began looking at the price of houses in the cities we listed. I started getting excited about the potential of moving and living somewhere that was more affordable and more racially diverse than Seattle. I got so enthralled with the possibility of moving to Minneapolis that I began dreaming about it.\nThe possibility of moving to Minnesota seemed like the perfect plan. It was close to Canada, where my wife is from, a day‚Äôs drive from where my parents live in Tennessee, but more importantly, it‚Äôs racially diverse and affordable. However, the dreams I was having about living in Minneapolis quickly turned into a nightmare. A nightmare that is the reality of many Black men living in America - the permanence of racism.\nThe racially motivated murder of George Floyd by a police office is another example of how racism in this country continues to persist and manifest itself in different ways. Similar to King, I too have a dream. I dream to live in a society that values Black lives. A dream where de facto segregation is no more. King dreamed over 55 years ago, I dreamed a similar dream only a few weeks ago. However, both of our dreams seem out of reach. The evils of this country have brought me to tears, not just for George Floyd, but for Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, Tony McDade, and so many other unarmed people of color murdered because of their skin color. It begs me to ask what is the price of a Black life, when will Black people be able to dream without fear of racism? I don‚Äôt know the answer, but I once heard someone say ‚Äì ‚Äúteamwork makes the dreamwork.‚Äù\nRacism was not created by Black people. On the contrary, it was created and reified by white people. Therefore, I‚Äôm convicted that it is not mine or any other Black person‚Äôs burden to eradicate racism, but rather the work of white people and those who benefit from racism. However, I can‚Äôt rest and dream easy until racism is a thing of the past. Therefore, Black, White, Indigenous, and Asian people need to work together so we can all rest and dream without fear.\n","date":1591488000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1591579938,"objectID":"2bea10d642f94c4c62dbfd6309d89f8e","permalink":"/post/dream/","publishdate":"2020-06-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/dream/","section":"post","summary":"racism defering dreams","tags":[],"title":"I Have a Dream Too","type":"post"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Pursuing a Ph.D. can be an isolating process, especially for minoritized students. For me, I‚Äôve found that my family is incredibly proud of my scholastic pursuits and don‚Äôt miss an opportunity to express that to me. However, there is also the consistent and sometimes exasperating occurrence of having to explain the importance of milestones in this process, such as submitting comprehensive exams or getting a conference proposal accepted.\nPursuing a Ph.D. for minoritized students can result in situations of being one of the few people who look like you in your classes. In some cases, whenever issues of inequity come up, you are tacitly looked upon for commentary about the situation and an ambassador for your race, religion, and/or ethnicity. However, this isolation can also occur in an advisory group.\nAdvisory group, in case other institutions call it something else or don\u0026rsquo;t have it, is the time when a faculty member regularly brings all of their advisees together as a group for a check-in or some structured activity.

Simultaneously YPAR works to create more socially just schools where youth are encouraged to take a lead in questioning policies and educational practices, including unequal power relations in our schools and society (Cammarota \u0026amp; Fine, 2008; Duncan Andrade \u0026amp; Morrell, 2008; Ginwright, Noguera, \u0026amp; Cammarota, 2006).\nYouth Films Collaborative (YFC) is a digital media initiative between Obama Academy (Pittsburgh Public Schools) and the Canevin Center for Educational Transformation and Social Justice at Duquesne University, in consultation with a faculty member from Nazareth College in Rochester, NY.\nBy providing a collaborative, experimental, mentored space in schools for 11th grade students, this project aims to sharpen participants‚Äô digital video production skills and give them new ways of engaging with a range of important critical multimodal literacy practices. More specifically, the YFC engages youth in the development of mini-documentary films on equity and social justice issues that are timely and relevant for youth-schools-communities using their ‚Äúvoice‚Äù. The concept of voice is used to show how people resist oppression, as seen in many feminist and post-feminist theories (Belenky, Clinchy, Goldberger, \u0026amp; Tarule, 1986; hooks, 2000). Voice also refers to instances where youth attempt to overcome and resist the ways in which schools and communities work to silence (Fine, 2003) and marginalize students by reproducing inequalities on account of race, class, gender, disability, and sexuality (Bowles \u0026amp; Gintis, 1976; Oakes, 1985). Voice is used in this presentation to question who gets to speak and who gets to make decisions with regard to school and community issues that directly impact youth. As such, the YFC seeks to cultivate reflective and change-centered processes (including the development of youth‚Äôs critical thinking and research skills), as well as practices which promote relationship building and inter-cultural dialogue with peers and adults in and outside of school.\nOver the course of the 2104-2015, we are in the process of: ‚Ä¢\tIdentifying community issues that are important to youth ‚Ä¢\tAsking essential research questions about the community issues ‚Ä¢\tCollecting data and reading literature on the issue ‚Ä¢\tCreating a mini-documentary on a social issue ‚Ä¢\tDistributing the video online, through social media, and film festivals and in public screenings ‚Ä¢\tOrganizing ‚Äúaction events‚Äù around their video with the following questions - What is the change that you would like to see with regard to the community issue? How do we create action around the message in the mini-documentary film?\n","date":1430611200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1430611200,"objectID":"3ed17cb02c96c07b4937887166efd23d","permalink":"/project/youth-films-collaborative/","publishdate":"2015-05-03T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/youth-films-collaborative/","section":"project","summary":"Youth Participatory Action Research to spur collective action","tags":["Equity","Qualitative Methods"],"title":"Youth Film Collaborative","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"  Key Takeaways Youth Initiative District students make steady gains in reading and math in elementary and middle school but tend to regress in high school.\n On average, Youth Initiative District students miss 12 days of instruction. Most of the absenteeism is occurring at the high school level.\n Male students of color in high school are experiencing the lowest amount of RIT math growth.\n   Summary of Findings The State University Youth Initiative District (SUYI) is comprised of 881 students across 16 schools consisting of elementary, middle, and high school students. SUYI is rich in diversity; there are 13 different races/ethnicities, over 10 primary languages, and a host of other characteristics that make this a rich community of students. Unfortunately, many SUYI students struggle with absenteeism and declining MAP Growth Rasch UnIT (RIT) scores.\nA student is considered ‚Äúchronically absent‚Äù when they miss 10% or more days of instruction in one academic school year (Childs \u0026amp; Lofton, 2021). Chronic absenteeism can lead to students missing important instructional time, ultimately causing students to fall behind in their academics. Furthermore, when students miss school, they also miss important social interaction times that develop their interpersonal skills. According to this analysis, SUYI students miss an average of 12 days of instruction, which is about 7% of the school year in Washington State. High School students make up for the majority of the days missed, with New Futures Alternative, Cascade High School, and Olympic High School having the highest median of absenteeism (20-48 missed days). On the other hand, elementary school students account for the least amount of absences. Horizon, Franklin, and Valley Elementary have the lowest amount of students missing school (4-6 missed days).\nRIT scores range from about 100‚Äì300. According to Joi Converse (2016), third-grade students usually score at the 180‚Äì200 level and progress to the 220‚Äì260 level by high school. SUYI elementary students fall within the usual RIT score range and make considerable gains in middle school. However, gains begin to slow down and in some cases regress for high school students. Declines in math RIT scores occurred from fall to winter for high school students, particularly male students of color. Most of these declines may be coming from Cascade High School and New Futures Alternative. In terms of actual scores, the average high school reading and math score was below 220. More specifically, the average spring RIT score in math was below 220.\nBased on this analysis, more attention needs to be given to male high school students of color with a primary focus on their math achievement. However, that achievement may not improve if high school students continue to miss school. Further analysis should be done to measure the statistical significance of students missing school on their academic achievement and the characteristics of students who are missing school and performing low in math. Lastly, caution should be taken with how much emphasis is given to RIT scores. Several scholars have noted inherent bias and lack of cultural awareness in standardized tests.\nReferences: Childs, J., \u0026amp; Lofton, R. (2021).
