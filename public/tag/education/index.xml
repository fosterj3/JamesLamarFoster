      <title>The Robots Are Here!</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Robots are here! No, I’m not talking about Asimov’s conception of robots running the world or the Will Smith movie, I Robot, which is based on Asimov’s writing (for my millennial readers). When I say, “the robots are here,” I’m not referring to automation taking over everyday jobs causing massive unemployment and people having to learn new skills to keep up with the changing technology. When I say, “the robots are here,” I’m referring to the person you see every morning when you look in the mirror. Yes, that’s right, you and I are the robots!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I think of robots, I think of emotionless and monotonous beings that struggle relating to one another, lacking in showing empathy, and spending the majority of their lifespan concerned about efficiency and productivity. Does this sound familiar? This phenomenon became clear to me when I began thinking deeply about the core of my dissertation work. My work centers on students’ well-being and how school leaders attend to Black and Brown students’ emotional needs. There has been an increase in public and private schools investing in curricula and initiatives that teach students how to name and regulate their emotions (which I find extremely important). You may have heard of some of the initiatives, such as student-centered approaches, Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports (PBIS), whole-child approaches, and/or social-emotional learning (SEL), to name a few.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I began reading more and talking to school leaders about some of these initiatives, particularly SEL, I kept asking myself, “what is the purpose of this and to what end?” As I read the literature and continued speaking to school leaders, the answer was troublesome. The purpose was to make happy, efficient, and productive robots. The goal wasn’t to ensure students were emotionally intelligent or for people to relate better with others, the goal was still efficiency and productivity. The goal is to make sure students will stay on task to get their classwork done, the goal was to make sure people could work with other people to finish an organization’s goals. Does this sound like a student-centered approach? This sounds more like a productivity-centered or authority-centered approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the school leaders I talked to use an SEL curriculum called RULER that is famous for its 4-color “Mood Meter.” Red means high energy – unpleasant, Blue is low energy – unpleasant, Green is low energy – pleasant, and Yellow is high energy – pleasant. But of course, all of these colors/emotions are on a spectrum. Some students may not be fully in the red or fully in the yellow, they may be somewhere in the middle. I spoke to a particular school leader about their use of RULER; they told me that they see it as a helpful tool to identify how a student or teacher may be feeling so they can properly attend to students&amp;rsquo; or teachers&amp;rsquo; present needs (period).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The school leader I spoke to acknowledged and understood that school is about kids, it’s not about grades, it’s not about being in the yellow quadrant, it’s not about following rules. As I sat back and thought about what I was learning from these school leaders, I got a glimpse of how the US’ capitalistic society has damned everything including our children’s education. As the US continues to innovate and produce new technologies to make our lives’ easier by asking Google or Alexa to turn on our lights or tell us a story, we devolved in our ability to talk to one another and show empathy because we’ve learned to do those things in the context of getting a task done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For us to thrive as a society - we can’t continue down the path of viewing emotional regulation as a means to an end - emotional regulation must be the end. Emotional intelligence must be the goal. Maybe it’s okay if you or your student is in the Red, maybe it’s okay if you’re in the Blue and feel like spending your day being comforted by your pets or speaking to your family. But, for it to be ok, we have to as a society realize that feeling is a what makes us human. Being human is a good thing. Let’s all try to be less like a robot and more like a human.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Talk to Teachers</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;These tumultuous times have renewed my interest in reading and listening to more Black scholars who have experienced and written about hardships in the United States. I find myself going back to the writings of James Baldwin for clarity and understanding. Baldwin quenches my thirst for needing to make sense of today&amp;rsquo;s political and racial climate and my role as an educator. I turn to Baldwin because I know he will tell it to me straight, he won’t bite his tongue nor soften his tone in his writing. I know that each time I read Baldwin; he will give me the unfiltered truth without any equivocation. To help me make sense of my role in education in today&amp;rsquo;s climate, I turned to Baldwin’s &amp;ldquo;A Talk to Teachers.&amp;rdquo; Despite this talk being over 50 years old, first given in 1963, educators have plenty to glean from this talk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The year 1963 had much uncertainty and unrest for many Americans, particularly African Americans. It started with George Wallace being elected governor of Alabama and giving an infamous speech in which he proclaimed, &amp;ldquo;segregation now, segregation tomorrow, and segregation forever!&amp;rdquo; Shortly thereafter in April, Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Rev. Ralph Abernathy, Rev. Fred Shuttlesworth, and others were arrested in a Birmingham protest for &amp;ldquo;parading without a permit.&amp;rdquo; This is also the same time MLK penned his now famously called &amp;ldquo;Letter from Birmingham Jail.&amp;rdquo; In May, thousands of African Americans, many of them students, protested segregation in Birmingham. Public Safety Commissioner Eugene &amp;ldquo;Bull&amp;rdquo; Connor unleashed fire hoses and police dogs on protestors before arresting them. In June, Medgar Evers is assassinated in Jackson, Mississippi (his killer wasn&amp;rsquo;t convicted until 1994). In September, The 16th Street Baptist Church bombing in Birmingham, Alabama killed four children and injures 22 others. The following month in October, is when Baldwin gave his talk to teachers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As all this turmoil was occurring, students across the nation were getting up each day and going to school knowing what was happening in Alabama and across the country. How should a teacher address their students given the political and racial climate? Can a teacher dismiss the politics for fear of being political and continue class as planned? Should teachers seek to be neutral? I imagine Baldwin would emphatically tell teachers not to give in to the lie. In such a time like this, there is no neutral space, neutrality is a myth hoped for by the faint-hearted. As I read Baldwin&amp;rsquo;s talk, I noticed three simple lessons he gave teachers: 1) speak the truth, 2) develop young people&amp;rsquo;s critical consciousness, and 3) believe in the power within young people to change society. Baldwin gives these lessons with the understanding that in order for educators to enact these lessons, they must engage in their own critical self-reflection and questioning of society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;United States residents are standing on stolen Indigenous land that was built by forcibly enslaved Africans for the benefit of White people. Any deviation from this harsh reality is simply untrue. However, similar to 1963, there is a fierce campaign for schools not to teach anything that may paint the United States in a negative light, as evidenced by the federal government&amp;rsquo;s 1776 commission and attacks against critical race theory. Educators must speak the truth about what this country has stood for and who it is designed to benefit. As Baldwin states, this country is not tormented externally, but internally. In his own words, he says &amp;ldquo;it is not really a “Negro revolution” that is upsetting the country. What is upsetting the country is a sense of its own identity.&amp;rdquo; America is in a pivotal moment in that it has a decision to make on whether or not it wants to face its true identity and progress or continue promoting falsehoods and stall any potential growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Baldwin, the purpose of education is to develop independent critical thinkers. Education is needed to help students look at the world and make their own decision by questioning society and the world so they can develop their identity. Baldwin warns teachers that this kind of person is not auspicious within US society. He says the US simply wants a &amp;ldquo;citizenry which will obey the rules of society.&amp;rdquo; Compliance has been a hallmark in many classrooms, even virtual ones. Such compliance can rob students of expressing how they feel and who they are. Choosing to develop a person&amp;rsquo;s critical consciousness rather than steering them to be more compliant can lead to young people to access the agency they have to create the change this society desperately needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baldwin says society&amp;rsquo;s hope lies in the convictions of young people, convictions that will lead to self-determination and collective action. Societies change when people critically examining them and take action to change them. Baldwin once said, he criticizes America because he loves America. If it was not for a person&amp;rsquo;s commitment and love for their country, they would not develop such convictions and critique it when it does not live up to its potential. Educators have a unique role and opportunity to change the world by pouring into young people. In his talk with Nikki Giovanni, Baldwin called teaching a “revolutionary act.” The revolution begins by teachers speaking the truth, developing young people&amp;rsquo;s critical consciousness, and believing that young people can change society for the better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The year 2020 has been tough for everyone. I believe teachers and educators across this nation need to heed the words of James Baldwin as they did in 1963. Baldwin&amp;rsquo;s lessons are not just for the benefit of students of color, but for White students as well. As he says, &amp;ldquo;if one managed to change the curriculum in all the schools so that Negroes learned more about themselves and their real contributions to this culture, you would be liberating not only to Negroes, you’d be liberating white people who know nothing about their own history.&amp;rdquo; America can only be free when America teaches the truth.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>My Blogging Journey</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In my first year of graduate school, a professor told me that a Ph.D. is a writing degree more than anything else. He stated I will have to learn how to write for multiple audiences and receieve feedback from multiple people.That last part - getting feedback- made me self-conscious. I&amp;rsquo;ve never had an aversion to writing but ever since grade school, I&amp;rsquo;ve struggled with sharing my writing. My hesistance in sharing my writing is due to the possibility of being misunderstood and an insecurity in my ability to what I perceived to be on par with my peers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As my third-year of graduate school and taking classes comes to an end, I realize that I&amp;rsquo;ve shared my writing with a countless number of professors, peers, and colleagues. As a result, I&amp;rsquo;ve seen an incredible amount of growth in my writing due to how often I&amp;rsquo;ve written academic papers and the feedback I&amp;rsquo;ve received. My perspective on sharing my writing has also changed. Rather than viewing it with fear and anxiety, I see it as a joy and opportunity to refine my writing. I hope to continue my writing growth by extending my writing audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope to use this website as one mechanism to increase my writing audience so I can improve my writing. My desire with these posts are to share what I&amp;rsquo;m learning as a data analyst, researcher, academic, son, brother, and husband. I hope you all will join me on this journey by engaging with me via this website and 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/Jmar116&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;twitter&lt;/a&gt;. Let the journey begin!&lt;/p&gt;
