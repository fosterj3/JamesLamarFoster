      <description>&lt;p&gt;I grew up in a military household. My father served in the United States Army for 20 years, 11 months, and 4 days (he would mention this often when he first retired). My dad is what you would call “a soldier’s soldier.” He was an Airborne Ranger who was also a marksman with air assault qualification. He was a drill sergeant and trained many other soldiers in combat warfare tactics. You would think with all these military accolades my dad was an avid gun user and had guns at home. On the contrary, my father never owned a gun outside of military use. In fact, I don’t ever remember a gun being brought in our house. Furthermore, my dad wouldn’t even allow me to have toy guns. Many of the kids I grew up around were also military brats (that’s what military kids referred to themselves as). Some of the kids I grew up around owned toy guns and would act like they were soldiers on the battlefield, shooting each other with dart guns. No matter how much I begged my dad to get me a toy gun, he refused.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One summer, when I was visiting my Aunt Vilma in Atlanta, she took me with her to run a few errands. I loved visiting Atlanta in the summer. My Aunt Vilma dedicated her life to be an elementary school teacher; she never had a significant other or kids. As a result, my sisters and I were the closest to being her children. While she and I were out, we stopped at the Dollar Store. As we perused the aisles to pick up a few essentials, I saw a green and yellow dart gun on the shelf. My eight-year-old self thought this was a perfect moment to finally get a toy gun. As my Aunt Vilma added things to the basket, I stealthily slipped in the dart gun. When the cashier started ringing up everything, my aunt looked at me and said, “did you put this in my basket?” (referring to the toy gun). I gave a big smile and pleaded, “can I please have it, Aunt Vilma?” She gave me a stoic look and allowed the cashier to ring it up. I was so elated. As soon as I got back to my aunt’s house, I loaded up the darts and started shooting at every glass surface in the house. My dad became aware of what I was doing and calmly asked to see the dart gun. I hesitantly gave it to him, knowing that he would not be happy. Once I handed it to him, he quickly broke it with his bare hands and threw it in the trash. I furiously ran to my mom and cried.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My mom and dad sat me down and told me that I couldn’t have a toy gun because people may perceive that I have a real gun and get me in trouble. I was so confused, “my other friends were allowed to have guns, why can’t I?” They said plainly, “it’s because people perceive Black people differently than white people.” I exclaimed, “that&amp;rsquo;s not fair!” They agreed and said “that’s just the world we live in.” My dad had always been somewhat strict, I thought him not allowing me to have a toy gun was just another example of him being surly. At that moment, I didn’t believe what my parents were telling me. I saw my dad’s actions as just being mean and not wanting me to have any fun. I was a child; children play with toy guns. Why can’t I just be a child? I never owned a toy gun again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When my cousins and I would get together at my Aunt’s house, we would take our Aunt Vilma’s plastic decorative bananas and use them to play cops and robbers. It seemed so ridiculous, but it was our way of circumventing our parents’ rule of not allowing us to have toy guns. As I got older, my desire to play cops and robbers began to subside. However, conversations on race and racism became more common. This was particularly true when I started dating and driving. My parents were wary of me dating anyone who was not a person of color because of the backlash that came with it. When I got my driver’s license, they instructed me on several occasions to not drive in certain neighborhoods and to watch my speed when I drove through different counties and cities, especially while driving in Tennessee where they ended up settling after my dad’s military career. When I went to college, I realized my upbringing was not that much different from other Black men.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I reflect on my upbringing, I realize how much racism controls/polices the way Black people interact in the world. I no longer resent my parents for not allowing me to own a toy gun. I realize they were merely trying to protect me. However, I can’t help but think about how racism has affected the way I move throughout the world, whether it’s something as simple as the toys I could play with as a child or the person I choose to love. However, despite the ostensible limitations racism has created for me and other Black people, we continue to beat the odds given to us. We continue to press forward and flourish. Despite the hardships, I wouldn’t want to be anything other than Black. Knowing that I come from a generation of people who have fought and died for liberation and equality gives me the strength to press on. My resilience comes from my faith and ancestors.&lt;/p&gt;
