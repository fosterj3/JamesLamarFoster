      <description>&lt;p&gt;I grew up in a military household. My father served in the United States Army for 20 years, 11 months, and 4 days (he would mention this often when he first retired). In typical military household fashion, my family and I moved just about every two years. Moving and visiting my Aunt Vilma in Atlanta, GA each summer were the two constants of my upbringing. Many of the places we moved to were either in Europe or in the southern region of the US. My mother is an immigrant from Panama and my father is a Florida native. My dad enlisted in the military at 17 years old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My dad is what you would call “a soldier’s soldier.” He was an Airborne Ranger who was also a marksman with air assault qualification. He was a drill sergeant and trained many other soldiers in combat warfare tactics. You would think with all these military accolades my dad was an avid gun user and had guns at home. On the contrary, my father never owned a gun outside of military use. In fact, I don’t ever remember a gun being brought in our house. Furthermore, my dad wouldn’t even allow me to have toy guns. Many of the kids I grew up around were also military brats (that’s what military kids referred to themselves as). Some of the kids I grew up around owned toy guns and would act like they were soldiers on the battlefield, shooting each other with dart guns. No matter how much I begged my dad to get me a toy gun, he would refuse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One summer, when I was visiting my Aunt Vilma in Atlanta, she took me with her to run a few errands. I loved visiting Atlanta in the summer, but my aunt would always put me to work. My Aunt Vilma dedicated her life to be an elementary school teacher; she never had a significant other or kids. As a result, my sisters and I were the closest to being her children. Some of the summer tasks included helping her move items from one room to another, cleaning the garage, shining brass plant pots, or accompanying her while she ran errands. While she and I were out, we stopped by the Dollar Store. As we perused the aisles to pick up a few essentials, I saw a green and yellow dart gun on the shelf. My eight-year-old self thought this was a perfect moment to finally get my own toy gun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As my Aunt Vilma added things to the basket, I stealthily slipped in the dart gun. As the cashier started ringing up everything, my aunt looked at me and said, “did you put this in my basket?” I gave a big smile and pleaded, “can I please have it, Aunt Vilma?” She gave me a stoic look and allowed the cashier to ring it up. I was so elated. As soon as I got back to my aunt’s house, I loaded up the darts and started shooting at every glass surface in the house. I shot the tv, I shot the mirrors, I shot the windows, I even shot at my sisters! My dad became aware of what I was doing and calmly asked to see the dart gun. I hesitantly gave it to him, knowing that he would not be happy. Once I handed it to him, he quickly broke it and threw it in the trash. I was furious… I ran to my mom and cried.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My mom and dad both told me that I couldn’t have a toy gun because of how people may perceive that I have a real gun and get me in trouble. I was so confused, my other friends were allowed to have guns, why can’t I? They said plainly, it’s because people perceive Black people differently than white people. I exclaimed, that not fair. They agreed and explained that’s the world we live in. As I got older, conversations like this became more quotidian. Particularly when I was in middle school and high school and started dating and driving. Conversations of race and racism were a common occurrence growing up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I reflect on it now, I realize how much racism controls/polices the way Black people interact in the world. I no longer resent my parents for not allowing me to own a toy gun. I realize they were merely trying to protect me. However, I can’t help but think about how racism has affected the way I move throughout the world, whether it’s something as simple as the toys I could play with as a child or the neighborhoods I can jog in. However, despite the limitations racism has created for me and Black people, we continue to beat the odds given to us. We continue to press forward and flourish through creativity. Despite the hardships, I wouldn’t want to be anything other than Black.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>I Have a Dream Too</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;“What&amp;rsquo;s the price for a black man life?
I check the toe tag, not one zero in sight
I turn the TV on, not one hero in sight”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;J. Cole&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On August 28, 1963, Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his renowned “I Have a Dream Speech.” In this speech, King expressed his aspirations for how the United States of America could one day look. An America where African descendants of slaves and European descendants of slave-owners could sit together as siblings and see each other as equals. An America where every person can sing the national anthem with a sense of pride and belief in the ideals expressed. An America where people are judge by their character and not by their skin color. This was King’s dream. A child today would most likely see’s King’s dream as something basic or mundane. As we know, it was nothing of the sort. I began to reflect on King’s dream these past two weeks when my dreams for the next couple of the years crashed into reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before the state issued stay-at-home orders to flatten the spread of coronavirus, I spent 2 hours of my day commuting to and from campus Monday through Friday. I used the ten extra hours I “gained” from not commuting to work on a few side projects and plan for life after graduation. I started building a website in preparation for when I get on the job market, my wife and I made a list of potential cities in which we wanted to live, I downloaded the Zillow app and began looking at the price of houses in the cities we listed. I started getting excited about the potential of moving and living somewhere that was more affordable and more racially diverse than Seattle. I got so enthralled with the possibility of moving to Minneapolis that I began dreaming about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The possibility of moving to Minnesota seemed like the perfect plan. It was close to Canada, where my wife is from, a day’s drive from where my parents live in Tennessee, but more importantly, it’s racially diverse and affordable.  However, the dreams I was having about living in Minneapolis quickly turned into a nightmare. A nightmare that is the reality of many Black men living in America - the permanence of racism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The racially motivated murder of George Floyd by a police office is another example of how racism in this country continues to persist and manifest itself in different ways. Similar to King, I too have a dream. I dream to live in a society that values Black lives. A dream where de facto segregation is no more. King dreamed over 55 years ago, I dreamed a similar dream only a few weeks ago. However, both of our dreams seem out of reach. The evils of this country have brought me to tears, not just for George Floyd, but for Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, Tony McDade, and so many other unarmed people of color murdered because of their skin color. It begs me to ask what is the price of a Black life, when will Black people be able to dream without fear of racism? I don’t know the answer, but I once heard someone say – “teamwork makes the dreamwork.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Racism was not created by Black people. On the contrary, it was created and reified by white people. Therefore, I’m convicted that it is not mine or any other Black person’s burden to eradicate racism, but rather the work of white people and those who benefit from racism. However, I can’t rest and dream easy until racism is a thing of the past. Therefore, Black, White, Indigenous, and Asian people need to work together so we can all rest and dream without fear.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What are You Reflecting?</title>
      <link>/post/reflecting/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Pursuing a Ph.D. can be an isolating process, especially for minoritized students. For me, I’ve found that my family is incredibly proud of my scholastic pursuits and don’t miss an opportunity to express that to me. However, there is also the consistent and sometimes exasperating occurrence of having to explain the importance of milestones in this process, such as submitting comprehensive exams or getting a conference proposal accepted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pursuing a Ph.D. for minoritized students can result in situations of being one of the few people who look like you in your classes. In some cases, whenever issues of inequity come up, you are tacitly looked upon for commentary about the situation and an ambassador for your race, religion, and/or ethnicity. However, this isolation can also occur in an advisory group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advisory group, in case other institutions call it something else or don&amp;rsquo;t have it, is the time when a faculty member regularly brings all of their advisees together as a group for a check-in or some structured activity. For the most part, these spaces are curated by the faculty member because they are the ones who choose who they want to advise. I see the curation of an advisory group as an opportunity for faculty members to illustrate their commitment to equity. A faculty member&amp;rsquo;s advisory group, to some extent, is a reflection of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re a faculty member committed to equity, anti-racism, critical consciousness, then you have to ask yourself – what is the extent of my commitment to these ideals? Is equity something I just write about or is it something that influences my daily decisions as I interact within the different communities I am in. Is your advisory group pretty much homogenous in terms of race, language, religion, status, gender, and lived experience? If so, what does that say about your commitment to equity? Is equity something you merely write about or does it go deeper than that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way you interact with your academic community (conferences, journal reviews, scholarship, etc.), university community (faculty members, staff, grad students, etc.), and local community (neighbors, local nonprofits, community centers, etc.) should be a reflection of that commitment. What are you reflecting?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>My Blogging Journey</title>
      <link>/post/blogging/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In my first year of graduate school, a professor told me that a Ph.D. is a writing degree more than anything else. He stated I will have to learn how to write for multiple audiences and receieve feedback from multiple people.That last part - getting feedback- made me self-conscious. I&amp;rsquo;ve never had an aversion to writing but ever since grade school, I&amp;rsquo;ve struggled with sharing my writing. My hesistance in sharing my writing is due to the possibility of being misunderstood and an insecurity in my ability to what I perceived to be on par with my peers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As my third-year of graduate school and taking classes comes to an end, I realize that I&amp;rsquo;ve shared my writing with a countless number of professors, peers, and colleagues. As a result, I&amp;rsquo;ve seen an incredible amount of growth in my writing due to how often I&amp;rsquo;ve written academic papers and the feedback I&amp;rsquo;ve received. My perspective on sharing my writing has also changed. Rather than viewing it with fear and anxiety, I see it as a joy and opportunity to refin my writing. I hope to continue my writing growth by extending my writing audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope to use this website as one mechanism to increase my writing audience so I can improve my writing. My desire with these posts are to share what I&amp;rsquo;m learning as a data analyst, researcher, academic, son, brother, and husband. I hope you all will join me on this journey by engaging with me via this website and 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/Jmar116&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;twitter&lt;/a&gt;. Let the journey begin!&lt;/p&gt;
